Always apply when the file is in a /tests folder.
When asked to create a Google Ads Script test file, it will need a main() function and then to call another function which we're testing.
The file should do the bare minimum to test the function. Only include variables needed to test the functionality.
Include DEBUG_MODE which is set to true, then ensure logs are outputted to see what's happening.
A single example should be included unless told otherwise. You can ask the user for an example if needed.
We want to pass in as much info as possible e.g. ids Vs grabbing those IDs from reports/the api. This ensures single responsibility and a more testable script.

Always check whether in preview mode (AdsApp.getExecutionInfo().isPreview();) then ONLY run in preview mode. Exit early if not in preview mode. This is to prevent the user accidentally running in live mode and making unwanted changes.
