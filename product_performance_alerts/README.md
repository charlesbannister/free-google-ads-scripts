## Overview

I built this script because I needed a better way to keep an eye on my product performance in Google Ads. I've been using it for ages on my own accounts, and it's saved me a lot of headaches.

## What does it do?

It's both an alert system and a reporting tool.

You set your own rules using custom filters (clicks, conversions, ROAS, Ctr, etc). If any products are urgently underperforming, you'll know about it right away. You can also use it to create less time-sensitive alerts, reminding you to review performance.

## Alert System

- Get instant alerts if a product isn't hitting your targets
- You can set an email subject prefix—this shows up in the subject line, so you can filter or label these alerts in your inbox (emails can easily get lost otherwise)
- You can use different email addresses for different rules, and add multiple emails per rule

## Reporting

- Every time the script runs, it writes all the stats and results to a Google Sheet
- You get a clear, easy-to-review report of which products matched your rules + their performance

## Campaigns Supported

- ✅ Standard Shopping campaigns
- ✅ Performance Max campaigns

## What if I have suggestions?

Please let me know! Hearing your pain points is the number one way I can make improvements.
