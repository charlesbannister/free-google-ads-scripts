## Turn your search terms into nGrams

This script will create 1, 2, 3, and 4 word nGrams from search terms.

**Important:** This script is for Standard Shopping campaigns only. It will not work for Performance Max. See our PMax Search Term N-Grams script for Performance Max campaigns.

## What can this script do?

- 📊 **Reporting** - Generate detailed nGram reports in Google Sheets
- 🚨 **Alerts** - Send an email if an nGram gets over X clicks without a conversion
- ➖ **Add Negative Keywords** - Automatically add nGrams as negative keywords to a Negative Keyword List (optional)

## What's an nGram?

Let's say we have two search terms:

- google ads api development
- bing ads api development

The **1 word nGrams** will be: google, bing, ads, api, development

The **2 word nGrams** will be: google ads, ads api, api development, bing ads

Importantly, metrics will also be combined to provide total clicks, cost, conversions etc. per nGram.

## Use Cases

Use this script to:

- Run a report to analyze search term patterns
- Set up alerts e.g. send an email if an nGram gets over 100 clicks without a conversion
- Automatically add poor-performing nGrams as negative keywords
