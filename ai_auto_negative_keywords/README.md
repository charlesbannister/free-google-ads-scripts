# AI Auto Negative Keywords

autoneg.shabba.io

## Description

Google Ads is becoming less about what you want to target, and more about what you need to exclude. With this advanced tool, you can setup intelligent rules to ensure wasteful, irrelevant search terms are excluded before money is wasted on clicks that won't convert.

This script supports Dynamic Search Ads (DSAs), Shopping Ads, Performance Max, and other campaign types, bringing back the precision control that keywords once provided while maintaining Google's intelligent matching for legitimate variations like misspellings and typos.

### Key Features

- **Auto Negative Keywords (Positive Keywords)**: Set up rules to automatically exclude irrelevant terms
- **Approx. Match Setting**: Intelligent matching that won't exclude legitimate variations (e.g., "banksie" when targeting "banksy")
- **Search Term Alerts**: Get notified when performance metrics exceed thresholds
- **AI/LLM Integration**: Let AI review search terms and suggest broad match negatives or relevance scoring
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Track results across different lookback windows with detailed KPIs
- **Perfect for Brand Campaigns**: Stricter matching control for brand protection
