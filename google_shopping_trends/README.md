## What this script does

Product stats as an average across 6 different time periods.

**As an average?** E.g. if the lookback window (days) is 365, it's the total clicks across 365 days (to yesterday) divided by 365.

**Recommended Schedule:** Hourly if looking at today, otherwise daily.

To create a new report, just duplicate an existing report tab then add your settings.

## How many reports can I add?

The only limit is the script runtime of 30 minutes.

Should the script timeout, either reduce the number of reports or add further Item ID or Campaign filters.

Don't forget you can install the same script multiple times, just update the Sheet URLs in each.

## What if I have suggestions?

Please let us know! Hearing your pain points is the number one way we can make improvements.
